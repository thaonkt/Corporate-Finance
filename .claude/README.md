### Project: Accounting Ratios Analysis

A 6-stage spec-driven design project. Students stand up their own public GitHub portfolio repo, populate the provided ratios template with financials for a company of their choice (non-U.S. and ASEAN-listed firms encouraged), and use an LLM to draft technical specifications and produce the final analysis — which they then critically evaluate.

| Stage | Deliverable | Weight | Format |
|-------|-------------|-------:|--------|
| 0 | Personal GitHub repo with README, RESUME, BIO | 5% | Repo URL |
| 1 | Provided ratios Excel template uploaded to your repo | 20% | `.xlsx` |
| 2 | Company selection memo | 10% | `.md` |
| 3 | Populated financials spreadsheet for selected company | 20% | `.xlsx` |
| 4 | LLM-drafted technical specification | 20% | `.md` |
| 5 | Full analysis + LLM evaluation + repo polish | 25% | Repo URL |

**Format:** All stages are **deliverable-only** — no in-class presentations this semester. Total project weight: 100%.

**Submission paths.** GitHub is the required submission channel — your Stage 5 deliverable is the public repo URL itself. Stages 2, 3, and 4 carry a **Lamaku-upload fallback** for students who hit hard blockers with Git setup; see the top of each stage doc for details. The fallback is a safety valve, not an alternate track — by Stage 5, all prior-stage artifacts must be consolidated into your GitHub repo.

**Student guides** (read as needed — none are required cover-to-cover):

- [`docs/guides/github-mba-guide.md`](../../docs/guides/github-mba-guide.md) — GitHub fundamentals, first commit, instructor write access, PR mechanics. **Read Sections 4–7 before Stage 2.**
- [`docs/guides/responding-to-pr-feedback.md`](../../docs/guides/responding-to-pr-feedback.md) — Rubric-shaped checklist for the Stage 5 PR-feedback line (5% of project). **Read the week before Stage 5.**
- [`docs/guides/vas-ifrs-gaap-ratio-quickref.md`](../../docs/guides/vas-ifrs-gaap-ratio-quickref.md) — Cross-standard reference for ratio interpretation (lease accounting, LIFO, goodwill amortization, R&D capitalization). **Read during Stage 3 if your company reports under VAS or IFRS; revisit at Stage 5 when interpreting ratios.**
- [`docs/guides/claude-code-install-for-non-technical-users.md`](../../docs/guides/claude-code-install-for-non-technical-users.md) — Optional. Windows/Mac walkthrough if you want to try Claude Code in a terminal.
- [`docs/guides/student-ai-enhancements.md`](../../docs/guides/student-ai-enhancements.md) — Optional / ungraded. Above-and-beyond paths (author a Claude Skill, try a Claude-for-Financial-Services plugin).

**Stage assignments:**
[Stage 0](stage0-repo-setup.md) |
[Stage 1](stage1-template-architecture.md) |
[Stage 2](stage2-company-selection-memo.md) |
[Stage 3](stage3-model-population-validation.md) |
[Stage 4](stage4-technical-specification.md) |
[Stage 5](stage5-llm-analysis-evaluation.md)

See [project design memo](docs/decisions/2026-04-03-bus629-accounting-ratios-project-design.md) for full rationale and pedagogical design.

### Project flow at a glance

Each stage produces a named artifact that the next stage consumes. The chain looks like this:

```
Stage 0 — Set up your portfolio repo (Stage 0 README)
              ↓
Stage 1 — Upload the ratios Excel template to your repo
              ↓
Stage 2 — Write a memo selecting your company → docs/decisions/
              ↓   (instructor reviews via pull request; you grant Write access)
Stage 3 — Populate the template with that company's financials → models/builds/
              ↓
Stage 4 — Use an LLM to draft a technical spec of the analysis → docs/specs/
              ↓   (one human-in-the-loop iteration recorded → in prompt log or analysis/validation/)
Stage 5 — Feed your spec to an LLM; verify, evaluate, and write the final analysis → deliverables/
          Polish the whole repo; submit the repo URL on Lamaku.
```

The repo at Stage 5 is your portfolio — the URL is shareable on LinkedIn and is the artifact the rubric grades.

### Project filename convention

Every project artifact uses the same naming pattern across all stages:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-{lastname}-{company-slug}-{kind}.{ext}
```

- **`YYYY-MM-DD`** — date you created the file (always lowercase, hyphen-separated, e.g., `2026-05-21`)
- **`{lastname}`** — your family name, all lowercase, no spaces (e.g., `nguyen`, `tran`, `pham`)
- **`{company-slug}`** — the company you're analyzing, all lowercase, hyphens for spaces (e.g., `vinamilk`, `fpt-corp`, `vingroup`)
- **`{kind}`** — what stage / what artifact (e.g., `selection`, `financials`, `spec`, `final-analysis`)
- **`{ext}`** — `md` for memos and analyses, `xlsx` for spreadsheets

Examples for a student named Nguyen analyzing Vinamilk:

| Stage | File |
|---|---|
| 2 | `docs/decisions/2026-05-21-nguyen-vinamilk-selection.md` |
| 3 | `models/builds/2026-06-04-nguyen-vinamilk-financials.xlsx` |
| 4 | `docs/specs/2026-06-18-nguyen-vinamilk-spec.md` |
| 4 (HIL note) | `analysis/validation/2026-06-19-nguyen-vinamilk-stage4-iteration.md` |
| 5 (raw LLM) | `deliverables/2026-07-02-nguyen-vinamilk-llm-raw.md` |
| 5 (verification) | `analysis/validation/2026-07-03-nguyen-vinamilk-stage5-verification.md` |
| 5 (final analysis) | `deliverables/2026-07-03-nguyen-vinamilk-final-analysis.md` |
| 5 (retrospective) | `deliverables/2026-07-03-nguyen-vinamilk-spec-retrospective.md` |

**Why lowercase?** GitHub on Linux servers treats `Nguyen-` and `nguyen-` as different files. Sticking to lowercase prevents broken links later.

### Project glossary

Terms used across the stage assignments. Skim once now; refer back as needed.

| Term | Plain-English meaning |
|---|---|
| **Repository (repo)** | A folder of files tracked by Git and hosted on GitHub. Your portfolio repo holds everything you produce in this project. |
| **Commit** | A saved snapshot of your repo at a moment in time, with a short message describing what changed. You will commit dozens of times across the semester. |
| **Commit history** | The chronological list of all commits in your repo. Reviewers (the instructor, managers, audit reviewers) can see it. |
| **Commit hash** | The unique ID (e.g., `ec8fa60`) of one commit. Used to point at a specific saved state. |
| **Pull request (PR)** | A proposed change to your repo, opened by you or a collaborator (the instructor). You read the suggested edits, comment on them, and either merge or reject. The instructor uses PRs to give you feedback on your memo, spec, and final analysis. |
| **YAML frontmatter** | The block of metadata at the top of a Markdown file, between two `---` lines. Looks like `title:`, `date:`, `author:`. The repo's templates use frontmatter to encode required fields — leave it intact when you customize a template. |
| **Named range** | A label assigned to a cell or group of cells in Excel (e.g., `BAL_assets_total_2025`) so formulas can refer to the label instead of the cell address. The ratios template uses named ranges so the formulas survive when you copy the workbook. |
| **Named-range notation** | The way we write formulas in the spec — using the named-range label instead of a cell address (e.g., `INC_net_income_2025 / BAL_assets_total_2025` rather than `B12 / D14`). |
| **Spec / specification** | The Stage 4 document that defines exactly what the analysis must do — precise enough that an LLM with no other context can execute it. |
| **LLM** | Large Language Model — Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc. The AI that drafts your Stage 4 spec and produces the Stage 5 first-draft analysis. |
| **HIL (human-in-the-loop)** | A workflow where you review an LLM's output, identify what's wrong, and revise either the prompt or the spec to improve the next run. Required at Stage 4. |
| **Diff** | A side-by-side comparison showing what changed between two versions of a file (the "before" and the "after"). Used in PRs and HIL iteration notes. |
| **Annotated diff** | A diff with one-line notes added next to each change explaining *why* you made it. |
| **10-K** | The U.S. SEC's annual report form for public companies. We use "10-K" loosely to mean "audited annual report" — for Vietnamese companies, the equivalent is the annual report filed under VAS (Vietnamese Accounting Standards) or IFRS. |
| **Prompt log** | A `deliverables/prompt-log.md` file in your repo where you record meaningful AI sessions (what you asked, what you kept, what you changed). |
| **Lamaku** | The University of Hawai'i at Mānoa's course management system, where you submit final URLs and access course resources. |
